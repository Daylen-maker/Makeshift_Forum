        <p>
          Revealing the ending of any movie, book, or your neighbor's surprise birthday party is strictly prohibited. Violators will be

        <p>
          Feel free to express yourself, but remember, anything you post must be as interesting as watching paint dry in reverse. If you can
          make the admin laugh, you earn the title of "Supreme Jester" for a day.

        <p>
          We use cookies, but not the delicious kind. Our cookies are digital and track how long you laugh at our jokes. If you don't laugh,
          they'll know. Also, we respect your privacy more than we respect people who talk at the theater.

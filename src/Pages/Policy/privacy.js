        <h2>Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We collect your laughs, chuckles, and guffaws. This data helps us ensure you're having a good time. If you're not laughing, we
          might send you a joke via email. If that doesn't work, check your pulse.

        <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your secrets are safe with us, mainly because we're terrible at remembering them. The only thing we share is good vibes and
          occasional internet memes.

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          We use third-party services to analyze how many times you've rolled your eyes at our jokes. These services are sworn to secrecy,
          under the penalty of being tickled.

        <p>
          We update our policies more often than we remember to water our plants. We'll let you know about any changes by sending a carrier
          pigeon or smoke signals, whichever is less practical.
